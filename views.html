		<h2>What impact do you want to have on the world and why?</h2>
		<p>
			I believe in a sense of humanity. Deep down, I know that we, as humans, 
			are all connected and we should treat each other with respect and acceptance. 
			To hurt a fellow human is to hurt oneself. I have seen countless instances of 
			people treating others poorly and hurting others for what they believe to be 
			their own personal gain. For instance, several video game communities are known
			for their toxicity and members often brag about their ability to “out-flame”
			their teammates. However, it’s possible that we hurt each other without even
			meaning to, such as how social media causes us to constantly compare 
			ourselves with how others portray themselves and feel insecure. Many can 
			relate to the feeling of being “ghosted,” ignored by someone’s 
			online presence. These are all examples of how technology has damaged our 
			relations between others since we only see actions, not intentions or 
			emotions. We are the most “connected” generation, 
			but we are also the most disconnected generation.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is my hope to rebuild real relations. To find a way to bring the human 
			characteristics we possess in the real world to the digital world. When we 
			meet others online, we should see more than a username so we understand 
			that we are communicating with another person, not presence. I want to be 
			able to rebuild our sense of empathy among others, because right now all 
			I see is an era of online shaming. Hatred has never been expressed so 
			freely and it desensitizes us from others’ emotions. To all the people 
			who have felt lonely, instead of making them feel left out, the digital 
			world should be able to help them feel connected to others once again. 
			It is my goal to find a solution to help them regain their sense of humanity.
