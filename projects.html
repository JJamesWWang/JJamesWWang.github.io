              For the first two months of my junior year, a bunch of my friends and I would pool
                all of our notes into a massive google doc to study for the tests.
              Eventually, I realized that was a pretty trash strategy for studying
                so I started a different way of note taking that involved extracting key terms
                from a textbook that our teacher gave us.
              I believed I would have a good idea of the chapter if I knew all of those terms.
              I knew just typing their definitions into a google doc would not help very much
                with studying, as I mostly memorized content through repeated testing.
              In order to make quizzes for myself, I programmed an automated process
                of reading my notes and asking questions.

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/JJamesWWang/discord_bots">Discord bots</a></h3>
            <p class="proj-desc">
              All of my friends can vouch for me when I say I use Discord a lot.
              It's 10x better than Skype, and actually has an API.
              I stumbled upon discord.py, a library that allows me to create bots (programmable users)
                and feed them commands to do what I want.
              It gives me a user interface whenever I want to show the effects of my code for myself
                or my friends and is a really useful tool.

            <p class="proj-desc">
              Originally made for a friend, this desktop app allows you to input
                the types of a Pokemon and will output its strengths and weaknesses.
              I used Comic Sans to annoy him.
